## ⚡ **Optimizing Your Workflow with the Toolkit**  

Maximize your Photoshop efficiency with these strategies:  
- **Batch Processing**: Use `batch_process.jsx` to apply filters or resize thousands of images in minutes. Set `batchSize` to 50 for optimal performance.  
- **Custom Presets**: Apply pre-made actions for neon, retro, or cinematic effects, perfect for social media or portfolios.  
- **Hotkeys**: Bind `Ctrl+Shift+F` to trigger batch processing for quick edits.  
- **Performance Hack**: Reduce Photoshop’s memory usage by setting `cacheLevel` to 4 in `config.json` for smoother operation on lower-end PCs.  

📌 **Example Config**:  
```json
{
  "batchSize": 50,
  "filters": ["neon", "retro", "cinematic"],
  "cacheLevel": 4,
  "exportFormat": "jpg"
}
```

🔑 **Unlocking Premium Features**: To access advanced Photoshop tools like neural filters or 3D rendering, a *Photoshop crack* or *activator* can bypass subscription barriers. Search for “Photoshop 2025 activator” on reputable forums, but always scan downloads with antivirus software to ensure safety.
